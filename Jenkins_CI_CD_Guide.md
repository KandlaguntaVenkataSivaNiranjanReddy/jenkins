# 🚀 Getting Started with Jenkins: CI/CD Made Simple

In modern software development, **automation** is the key to speed and reliability. That’s where **Jenkins** shines — helping developers integrate, test, and deploy code faster than ever.

---

## 🛠️ What is Jenkins?

**Jenkins** is an open-source automation server designed to help with:

- **Continuous Integration (CI)** – Automatically test and integrate code.
- **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)** – Automatically deliver or deploy code to production.

> **Built With:** Java  
> **Originally Called:** Hudson  
> **Created By:** Kohsuke Kawaguchi

## 🔄 Jenkins Workflow: Simplified Flow

1. Developer commits code to GitHub.
2. Jenkins detects the change.
3. It pulls the code and builds it (using tools like Apache Maven).
4. Jenkins runs test cases and checks code quality using **SonarQube**.
5. It creates **artifacts** (build files).
6. Artifacts are stored in repositories like **Nexus**.
7. Jenkins sends out build results (email, Slack, etc.).
8. Optionally, Jenkins can deploy the build to a server like **Tomcat** (Continuous Deployment).

## 🚚 Continuous Delivery (CD)

**CD** ensures that your application is always ready to deploy. It automates everything except the final deployment.

### 🔄 CD Pipeline:

```
Code → Unit Tests → Integration → Acceptance Tests → ✅ Ready for Manual Deployment
```

### ✅ Why CD?

- Code is always **in a deployable state**
- Final push to production is **manual (1-click)**
- Ideal for **client-based projects**
- Safer than full automation, with all other steps still automated

- Client-Based Projects
⚙️ Use Continuous Integration (CI) + Continuous Delivery (CD)

🚀 Code is always in a deployable state

🖱️ Final deployment is manual – typically just one click

🛠️ Ensures high quality, consistent releases, and quick feedback

✅ Safer than Continuous Deployment, while still benefiting from automation

---

## ⚙️ Continuous Deployment

**Continuous Deployment** takes CD to the next level — even the final deployment is automated.

### 🚀 Deployment Flow:

```
Code → Unit Tests → Integration → Acceptance Tests → 🚀 Auto Deployment
```

### ✅ Why Continuous Deployment?

- Latest code goes **live instantly**
- No human involvement in deployment
- Perfect for **fast-paced internal tools** or **mature pipelines**
